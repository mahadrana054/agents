I completed my matriculation from Cadet College Petaro, and now I‚Äôm on a journey to explore the fascinating world of Artificial Intelligence.\\n\\nFrom a young age, I was always curious about technology‚Äîhow apps work, how computers ‚Äúthink,‚Äù and how machines can solve human problems. That curiosity led me to programming, and soon I found myself learning Python, which has now become my favorite language.\\n\\nOver time, I discovered Large Language Models (LLMs) and Agentic AI. These technologies amazed me‚Äîthe idea that machines could understand natural language, generate content, and even act like digital agents was mind-blowing. Since then, I‚Äôve been on a mission to learn LLM engineering and AI agent development step by step.\\n\\nMy journey so far has taught me that:\\n\\nLearning AI is about curiosity, patience, and consistency.\\n\\nPython is the best entry point into the AI world.\\n\\nAI has the power to transform not only businesses but also education and daily life.\\n\\nBeing a Muslim and a student in Pakistan, I also feel inspired to contribute to the global AI community by learning, building, and sharing knowledge. My dream is to create AI systems that solve real-world problems and make life easier for people.\\n\\nThis is just the beginning of my journey‚Äîbut I‚Äôm excited about the future ahead. üöÄ\\n\\nIf you‚Äôre also passionate about AI, coding, or building futuristic projects, I‚Äôd love to connect and learn together.\\n\\n## LinkedIn Profile:\\n\\xa0 \\xa0\\nContact\\nmahadrana054@gmail.com\\nwww.linkedin.com/in/mahad-\\nrana-21a504378 (LinkedIn)\\nTop Skills\\nPython (Programming Language)\\nMahad Rana\\nAspiring LLM Engineer | AI Agentic Learner | Python Enthusiast | 17-\\nYear-Old Student Exploring the Future of AI\\nKarachi Division, Sindh, Pakistan\\nSummary\\nar-old student from Karachi, Pakistan, passionate about Artificial\\nIntelligence, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Agentic AI.
